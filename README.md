# 🤖 Machine Learning Algorithms – Case Studies

This repository is a structured collection of **machine learning algorithms implemented through detailed case studies and practical examples**.  
The goal of this project is to build a **deep, algorithm-level understanding of machine learning** by applying each algorithm to real datasets and analyzing its behavior, performance, and limitations 📊.

---

## 🎯 Objective

The primary objectives of this repository are to:

- 📘 Study machine learning algorithms **one by one**
- 🧠 Understand how each algorithm works in **real-world scenarios**
- 🗂️ Apply algorithms on real or standard datasets
- 📈 Analyze results instead of focusing only on accuracy
- 🛠️ Build strong foundations through **hands-on case studies**

This is a **long-term learning and reference project**, not just a collection of scripts.
